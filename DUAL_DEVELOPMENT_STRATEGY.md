# üîÑ Dual Development Strategy
## **Full Embr Development on Both Windows and Mac**

This guide enables seamless development of the Embr Universal Micro-App Framework across both Windows and Mac machines, with complete context preservation and synchronized workflows.

---

## üéØ **Dual Development Philosophy**

### **Both Machines Are Equal Development Environments**
- **Windows**: Full development + Windows-specific testing
- **Mac**: Full development + iOS testing + macOS testing
- **Seamless Switching**: Work on either machine without losing context
- **Complete Synchronization**: All changes flow through Git

### **Key Principles**
1. **Git as Single Source of Truth** - All development flows through version control
2. **Environment Parity** - Same tools and versions on both machines
3. **Context Preservation** - Complete project understanding on both platforms
4. **Platform-Specific Testing** - Test on the platform you're developing on

## üîÑ **Seamless Development Workflow**

### **Daily Development Routine (Either Machine)**

#### **Start of Development Session**
```bash
# 1. Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# 2. Install any new dependencies
npm install

# 3. Update development log
npm run devlog:update

# 4. Verify system integrity
npm run check:isolation
npm run audit:theme

# 5. Start development server
npm run dev
```

#### **During Development**
```bash
# Make changes, test locally
# Run quality checks frequently
npm run check:isolation
npm run audit:theme

# Test platform-specific features
# Windows: Test in Chrome, Edge, Firefox
# Mac: Test in Safari, iOS Simulator
```

#### **End of Development Session**
```bash
# 1. Run final quality checks
npm run check:isolation
npm run audit:theme

# 2. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: [description]"

# 3. Push to repository
git push origin feature/branch-name

# 4. Update development log
npm run devlog:append -- "Completed [feature description] on [platform]"
```

## üì± **Platform-Specific Development**

### **Windows Development Focus**
- **Web Development**: Chrome, Edge, Firefox testing
- **Windows-Specific Features**: Windows PWA features
- **Performance Testing**: Windows performance characteristics
- **Client Config Development**: JSON configs, Firebase integration

### **Mac Development Focus**
- **iOS Development**: Safari compatibility, iOS Simulator testing
- **macOS Development**: Safari on macOS, native macOS features
- **Capacitor Development**: iOS native builds, device testing
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Ensure features work on both platforms

---

## üîß **Environment Synchronization**

### **Node.js Version Management**
```bash
# Use same Node.js version on both machines
node --version  # Check current version

# If versions differ, install same version
# Download from: https://nodejs.org/
# Or use nvm (Node Version Manager)
```

### **Package Dependencies**
```bash
# Always use package-lock.json for consistency
npm ci  # Install exact versions from lock file

# After adding new dependencies on one machine:
npm install <package>
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "Add dependency: <package>"
git push

# On other machine:
git pull
npm ci  # Install exact versions
```

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Use .env files for platform-specific configs
# Create .env.local (gitignored) on each machine
# Example .env.local:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/service-account.json
```

## üìã **Development Context Preservation**

### **Complete Context on Both Machines**
Your existing documentation provides complete context:

1. **EMBR_KNOWLEDGE_LEDGER.md** - Complete project reference
2. **DEV_LOG.md + Daily Entries** - Development history and decisions
3. **DEVELOPMENT_ISOLATION_GUIDE.md** - Demo vs production separation
4. **CROSS_PLATFORM_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md** - Cross-platform strategy
5. **Automated Scripts** - Quality checks that work on both platforms

### **Context Switching Protocol**
```bash
# When switching to different machine:
# 1. Read latest DEV_LOG.md entry
# 2. Check EMBR_KNOWLEDGE_LEDGER.md for latest decisions
# 3. Run npm run check:isolation
# 4. Test with WILDROOTS2025 access code
# 5. Continue development seamlessly
```

## üß™ **Testing Strategy**

### **Platform-Specific Testing**
```bash
# Windows Testing
npm run dev
# Test in: Chrome, Edge, Firefox
# Test: PWA features, Windows-specific functionality

# Mac Testing  
npm run dev
# Test in: Safari, Chrome, Firefox
# Test: iOS Simulator, macOS features

# Native Testing (Mac only)
cd packages/hub-app
npx cap run ios
# Test: iOS native builds, device features
```

### **Cross-Platform Validation**
```bash
# After making changes on either machine:
# 1. Test on current platform
# 2. Commit and push changes
# 3. Switch to other machine
# 4. Pull changes and test
# 5. Document any platform-specific issues
```

---

## üîÑ **Git Workflow for Dual Development**

### **Feature Branch Strategy**
```bash
# Create feature branch on either machine
git checkout -b feature/feature-name

# Develop on either machine
# Make commits with descriptive messages
git commit -m "Feature: Add new component on [platform]"

# Push to remote
git push origin feature/feature-name

# Switch to other machine
git checkout feature/feature-name
git pull origin feature/feature-name

# Continue development seamlessly
```

### **Merge Strategy**
```bash
# When feature is complete:
# 1. Final testing on both platforms
# 2. Merge to main branch
# 3. Update development log
# 4. Deploy if ready
```

---

## üö® **Troubleshooting Dual Development**

### **Common Issues**

#### **Node.js Version Mismatch**
```bash
# Check versions on both machines
node --version
npm --version

# Install same version on both machines
# Use package-lock.json for dependency consistency
```

#### **Platform-Specific Dependencies**
```bash
# Some packages may be platform-specific
# Use optionalDependencies in package.json
# Test on both platforms after adding dependencies
```

#### **File Path Issues**
```bash
# Use forward slashes in code
import Component from './components/Component';

# Avoid platform-specific paths
// ‚ùå Wrong
import Component from '.\\components\\Component';
```

#### **Environment Differences**
```bash
# Use environment variables for platform differences
const isWindows = process.platform === 'win32';
const isMac = process.platform === 'darwin';

# Platform-specific configurations
const config = {
  windows: { /* Windows config */ },
  mac: { /* Mac config */ }
}[process.platform];
```

## üìö **Documentation Maintenance**

### **Keep Updated on Both Machines**
- **EMBR_KNOWLEDGE_LEDGER.md** - Project reference and decisions
- **DEV_LOG.md** - Development history and progress
- **Platform-Specific Guides** - Windows and Mac setup guides
- **Development Logs** - Document work on both platforms

### **Platform-Specific Notes**
```bash
# Document platform-specific findings
npm run devlog:append -- "Windows: [finding]"
npm run devlog:append -- "Mac: [finding]"
npm run devlog:append -- "Cross-platform: [finding]"
```
