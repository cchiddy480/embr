## 4. Standalone-App Generator
- [ ] Automate standalone app builds for each client
  - [ ] Script to inject config, icons, display name, bundle ID
  - [ ] Automate npx cap sync and platform builds
  - [ ] Test end-to-end: generate and side-load iOS/Android binaries
  - [ ] Document process for generating new client apps

## 5. CI/CD & Release Automation
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflows
  - [ ] Hub-App: build & deploy to TestFlight/Play Internal on main branch
  - [ ] Standalone: on tag push, run Fastlane to produce/upload release builds
  - [ ] Hook environment variables (Firebase keys, App Store creds) into CI secrets
  - [ ] Add status badges and build logs to repo

## 6. Analytics & Monitoring
- [ ] Integrate Firebase Analytics
  - [ ] Track first-launch, code entry, QR scan, config loads, expiry events, screen views
  - [ ] Set up Crashlytics for runtime error reporting
  - [ ] Add uptime monitoring for backend/config endpoints

## 8. Polishing & QA
- [ ] User testing on real devices (offline/online, expiry, QR, push)
