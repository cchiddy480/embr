# 2025-01-28 — Guardrails and Brief→Config Playbook

## Overview
- Implemented guardrails to ensure efficient, regression-free client builds from briefs.
- Locked in a repeatable Cursor workflow and validation steps.

## Changes
- Added theming audit script `scripts/theming-audit.js` and npm task `audit:theme`.
- Created Theme Sandbox route `packages/hub-app/src/app/embrkit-themes-demo/page.tsx`.
- Added PR checklist `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
- Updated `.cursorrules` with the “Build Client App Config From Brief” playbook.
- Replaced rgba literals in `ClientApp.tsx` with HSL alpha for audit compliance.
- Ran the audit – passing.

## Impact
- Prevents hardcoded colors, Tailwind `ring-*`, and legacy teal in client code.
- Ensures hub baseline visuals remain untouched.
- Provides a simple, consistent path from brief → config → hybrid UI → verified release.

## Next
- Optional: Add ESLint/Stylelint rules and CI visual snapshots (Playwright) to tighten enforcement.
