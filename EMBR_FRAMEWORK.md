## üéØ **What Embr Does**

Embr is a **universal micro-app framework** that delivers fast, branded, single-purpose digital tools for any client, any industry, any use case.

### **The Embr Promise:**
*"Need a tool? We'll build you one. Fast."*

## üõ†Ô∏è **The Embr Framework Architecture**

### **Technical Foundation**
- **Frontend**: Next.js + React + TypeScript
- **UI System**: EmbrKit Design System (our custom component library)
- **Mobile**: Capacitor for native app compilation
- **Backend**: Firebase + Firestore for dynamic configuration
- **Deployment**: Multi-modal (PWA, native apps, QR codes, access codes)

### **The Magic: Configuration-Driven Development**
Instead of building from scratch every time, Embr uses **dynamic configuration** to instantly adapt the same robust framework for any use case:

```javascript
// Breathing Timer App Config
{
  appType: "wellness-timer",
  branding: { colors: ["#calming-blue"], fonts: ["Inter"] },
  components: ["timer", "stats", "settings"],
  features: ["offline-mode", "progress-tracking"]
}

// Restaurant Menu Config  
{
  appType: "digital-menu", 
  branding: { colors: ["#restaurant-red"], fonts: ["Playfair"] },
  components: ["menu-items", "search", "allergen-filters"],
  features: ["image-gallery", "order-integration"]
}

// Property Tour Config
{
  appType: "property-showcase",
  branding: { colors: ["#luxury-gold"], fonts: ["Montserrat"] },
  components: ["interactive-map", "room-details", "contact-form"],
  features: ["virtual-tour", "appointment-booking"]
}
```
